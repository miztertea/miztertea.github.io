# Raid Rankings Website
This site provides up-to-date raid rankings for the Nerubar Palace Mythic Raid. It displays the top 20 ranked guilds from around the world, showing which bosses they've defeated and their best attempt percentages on bosses they’ve pulled but not yet defeated.

Each row represents a guild, and each column represents a boss in the raid. Defeated bosses are marked with a checkmark (✓), while bosses that haven’t been defeated but have been attempted will show the best percentage attempt.

This site is updated regularly to reflect the latest progression data.
